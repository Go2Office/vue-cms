It's been quite a long ago I started learning a programming with very poor knowledge about computing and that was hardcore tough for me . And that was Visual Basic during the year 2000.

But I always been with the learning and my life took me away from chasing a diversion of IT based programming.

After a long journey of life ended, I again started learning programming languages started with Python and finally I have decided to learn only frameworks based on JS and Python which will help me much develop web applications.

Off course, the story will remain if I dont mention about Github which came to my life as a savior to dive deep into learning many programming things and technics!
